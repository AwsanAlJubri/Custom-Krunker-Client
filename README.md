# Custom-Krunker-Client
Customized Krunker Desktop Client.

## Current Features
- Ad Hider ( not actually blocking ads for Free KR compatibility )
- Add compatibility with custom fonts for few social and market pages
- Customizable splash screen background
- Splash screen font size fix
- Few minor tweaks for debugging

### How?
If you're Windows user, download a installer from [latest release](https://github.com/Mixaz017/Custom-Krunker-Client/releases/latest).  
If you're Mac or Linux user, get [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) (or other builder/packager), clone or ZIP download this repository, and build/package it for yourself. I can't build Mac and Linux versions from a Windows PC.
